This project is my own version of the Google homepage.

I will be using only HTML and CSS to recreate the webpage.

I will apply all of my skills learned until now wich involve knowing the following:

* Using the correct HTML tags;

* Using Ids and classes;

* Knowing all types of CSS layouts;

* Knowing the navbar structure;

Everything including hovers working as it should.
The hardest thing to implement were the icons on the input box where I hard coded it into position.
